## Project 1
- ### My group and I were tasked to develop our own website using at least 2 server side  API's while using a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- ### Our website displayed an image from the dog.ceo API and gave 5 answer choices. One of the answer choices is a dog breed that relates the the image. We also used another API called DogDummyAPI to get a description of the dog breed to pop up when a button is clicked.
- ### THe technologies we used were API's, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Skeleton, and Bootstrap.
